This App is based off of a Chamber Flux Calculation App written in IDL: https://github.com/Wes-Skeeter/UBC-Portable-CO2-Chamber

I wanted to make it open soucre and more user friendly

Load a set of obsevations with plot,
Isolate the series of interest using the assing funciton, depth entry, and chamber ID key,
Drop erroneous data.

Calculate fluxes will iterate through series,
Use widets to isolate specific "2min" portion of series for calculations.

More details to come later
